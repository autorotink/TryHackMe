## Intro to Cyber Threat Intel
### Task 1 Introduction
- **CTI**: Cyber Threat Intelligence - vital for investigating and reporting against advesary attacks w/org stakeholders and external communities.
- **Objectives**:
	- Basics of CTI and various classifications
	- Lifecycle Stuff
	- Frameworks and Standards for distro.
- **CTI Module**
	- Threat Intelligence Tools
	- Yara
	- OpenCTI
	- MISP
### Task 2 Cyber Threat Intelligence
- "evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them"
- There's a difference between Data, Information, and Intelligence
	- Data: Indicators like IP addresses, URLs, hashes
	- Information: A combo of multiple data points can answer questions (something useful)
	- Intelligence: correlation of data and information to get patterns
- Goal: understand the relationship between the operational environment and the attacker, to know how to defend the environment.  Think:
	- Who are the attackers?
	- Motives and capabilities?
	- What artifacts and IOCs could there be?
- Gather threat intel from:
	- Internal: Corporate events like vuln assessments, IR reports, cyber awareness training reports
	- Community: Open web forums, Dark web communities for cybercriminals
	- External: Threat intel feeds, Online marketplaces, other public sources (gov't data, pubs, socials, financial and industrial assessments)
#### Threat Intelligence Classifications
Threat Intel is geared towards understanding the relationship between your environment and your adversary.  Different levels/types of intel:
- Strategic Intel: Think High-level.  Trends, patterns, and emerging threats that may impact a business decision.
- Technical Intel: IOCs and artifacts.  IR Teams use it to create a baseline attack surface to analyse and develop defense mechanisms.
- Tactical Intel: Assess adversaries TTPs.  Can strength security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.
- Operation Intel: Adversary's specific motives and intent.  Security teams use this intel to understand critical assets (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.
#### Questions
1. What does CTI stand for?
2. IP addresses, Hashes, and other threat artifacts would be found under which Threat Intelligence classification?
