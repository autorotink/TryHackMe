## Pyramid of Pain (from Top to Bottom!)
- TTP: The attacker's plans and objectives.
- Tools: The attacker has utilized these to accomplish their objective.
- Network: These artifacts can present themselves as C2 traffic for example.
- Domain Names: An attacker has purchased this and used it in a typo-squatting campaign.
- IP Addresses: These addresses can be used to identify the infrastructure an attacker is using for their campaign.
- Hashes: These signatures can be used to attribute payloads and artifacts to an actor.
